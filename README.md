# Rails kickstart

A Rails kickstart repo with the following stuff already configured:

- Webpacker handling assets
- Sass compilation
- Auto-annotating models
- Rubocop for formatting
- Editorconfig
- Scripts for managing application (setup, update, server, etc.)

Everything else is a blank slate. No CSS frameworks installed, just
use what you want.

## Why?

I made this because I was tired of redoing this over and over again
when I started a new project.

## What is the license?

As nothing really is here, it's licensed under the [Unlicense](LICENSE).
